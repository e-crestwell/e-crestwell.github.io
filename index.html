        <h1>Where Kinetic Firepower Meets Cognitive Warfare</h1>
        <p>
          Crestrity Technologies Inc. is a private weapons contractor operating at the junction of
          physical and informational conflict. We design systems that detonate in two domains:
          <strong>on impact</strong> and <strong>in perception</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From compact field-deployable devices to theatre-scale influence architectures,
          our portfolio is engineered for clients who understand that in the modern battlespace,
          destroying a target is not enough — you must also rewrite how the event is remembered.

            <h3>Kinetic Systems Division</h3>
            <p>
              Responsible for the design and integration of controlled-effect devices and
              modular delivery platforms. Our units are built for precision timing,
              predictable blast patterns, and seamless synchronization with upstream planning cells.
              <br><br>
              Each deployment package is paired with a tailored information layer —
              no action is isolated, everything is part of a sequence.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3>Cognitive Operations Division</h3>
            <p>
              Dedicated to shaping narratives before, during, and after impact.
              We orchestrate perception flows across feeds, channels, and closed communities,
              ensuring that when an event occurs, the story attached to it is already in motion.
              <br><br>
              Our teams specialize in making specific outcomes feel inevitable,
              and alternative interpretations feel irrational.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3>Systems Integration Cell</h3>
            <p>
              The point at which hardware and narrative are fused.
              Here, detonation timing, visual signatures, and post-event information
              are choreographed into a single operation.
              <br><br>
              Internally, this process is known as <em>“dual-domain locking”</em>:
              the moment when a physical incident and its preferred explanation become inseparable.

        <h2>Field Testing & Containment Protocols</h2>
        <p>
          Crestrity systems are evaluated in tightly controlled environments using live devices
          and fully instrumented perception corridors. Every test cycle analyzes not only
          structural response, but also how observers describe, share, and rationalize the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selected units are equipped with multi-stage safety architectures and remote
          disarm interfaces for red-team exercises and training scenarios.
          In the unlikely case that you are reading this as part of such an exercise:
          <strong>remember that every second you spend on the device,
          someone else is watching the story unfold.</strong>
