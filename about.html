        <h1>About Crestrity Technologies Inc.</h1>
        <p>
          Crestrity Technologies Inc. is a private weapons contractor operating in the grey zone
          between kinetic operations and cognitive warfare. Officially, we call it
          <strong>integrated effects engineering</strong> — the design of operations that
          land twice: once on the physical map, and once in the minds of everyone watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our clients are organizations that have learned the same lesson we have:
          in the information age, an explosion is only the first frame. What matters is
          the narrative that survives after the smoke clears.

        <div class="grid">

          <article>
            <h3>Chief Executive Officer</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Evelyn Crestwell</strong> founded Crestrity Technologies Inc. with a simple
              observation: most conflicts are lost long before the first device is armed.
              Her background spans defense contracting, behavioral analytics, and
              large-scale information operations design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside Crestrity, she is known less as a “CEO” and more as an architect —
              the person who insists that every deployment package includes its own
              post-event story arc, distribution channels, and fail-safe narratives.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article>
            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              Crestwell’s doctrine can be summarized in three questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>What is the visible event?</em></li>
              <li><em>Who is allowed to explain it first?</em></li>
              <li><em>Which version still feels true a week later?</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Crestrity’s systems are built to answer all three at once. Under her direction,
              the company invests equally in hardware, signal choreography,
              and the subtle engineering of “obvious” conclusions.
            </p>

        <h2>Operational History</h2>
        <p>
          Publicly available records describe Crestrity as a “specialized consulting firm”
          focused on risk modeling and strategic communications. Internally, that description
          is treated as the first successful field test: a clean, forgettable cover story.
        </p>

        <p>
          While most of our work remains compartmentalized, several program codenames appear
          across internal briefing material:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PROJECT LAMIA</strong> — early research into dual-domain locking,
              where physical incidents and preferred explanations are engineered together.</li>
          <li><strong>CASCADE SERIES</strong> — iterative development of autonomous conflict simulators
              that stress-test narrative chains under live-fire conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>VEIL GLASS</strong> — perception-mapping frameworks used to identify
              which observers must never see the same version of an event.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Officially, none of these programs exist. Unofficially, they define how Crestrity
          evaluates every operation: by the silence it leaves behind, not the noise it creates.

    <!-- Ethos -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>
          Crestrity Technologies was built on the premise that power in the modern world
          is exercised less through force, and more through <em>framing</em>.
          Devices can be disarmed. Networks can be rebuilt. But a conclusion that feels
          self-evident is almost impossible to uproot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our role is to design operations that respect this reality — for clients who
          understand that every detonation, every leak, every “accident” exists inside
          a larger script.
